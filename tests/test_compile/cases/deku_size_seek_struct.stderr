error: DekuSize cannot be derived for types with seek attributes (seek_rewind, seek_from_current, seek_from_end, seek_from_start). Seek operations make size unpredictable.

   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `SIZE_BITS`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `deku::DekuSize`
